# momento - bec's branch

## Updates so far:

* Added the home screen for P5

* There's a timeline! Made w/ -> [react-native-timeline-listview](https://github.com/thegamenicorus/react-native-timeline-listview) 

* A button that will eventually take you to the 'create moment' screen -> Expo reccommends that we use [this](https://reactnavigation.org/) . Play around with it [here](https://expo.io/@react-navigation/NavigationPlayground)


## TODO

* make "Create Moment" screen
* add navigation to this screen
* figure out a way to actually add events to the timeline
